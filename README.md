# **Bank Loan Insights - Power BI Dashboard**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project involves analyzing bank loan data to gain insights into loan approvals, defaulters, and customer demographics. The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive view of key metrics, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Loan Approval Analysis**: Breakdown of approved and rejected loans.  
- **Customer Demographics**: Insights into borrower age, income, employment type, and credit history.  
- **Loan Performance**: Identification of high-risk defaulters and trends in non-performing loans.  
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Filters and drill-downs for detailed analysis.  

## **Dataset**  
- **Source**: Kaggle 
- **Fields**:  
  - Loan ID, Customer ID  
  - Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Term  
  - Income, Credit Score, Employment Type

- DAX Measures for KPIs (Approval Rate, Default Rate, Average Loan Amount)  
- Slicers and Filters for dynamic reporting  
- Custom Visualizations (Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Heatmaps, etc.)  

## **Insights & Findings**  
- High-income customers have a higher approval rate.  
- Loan default rates are higher among self-employed individuals.  
- Short-term loans have a lower default rate compared to long-term loans.
